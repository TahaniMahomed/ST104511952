History app - part one
I was tasked to create an historicial app that allows a user to delve into the realms of the past and grasp important facts about political people who made a difference in todays society.  I set out to create the Historical Figure Finder App—a digital portal to the stories of historical faces. The Historical Figure Finder App's idea is  simple yet profoundly engaging. Users enter an age between 1 and 100, and with a single tap, they gain access to the life of a historical figure who made a significant contribution at that time. When developing and coding for the app, various things had to be considered, including the following: 
1.	image views -  4 image views was used to create the app's background, and the other is in the upper right corner to add decoration and personalization to the app. 

2.	. Buttons - The application has two buttons, making it easy for the user to enter values. One of these buttons is a submit button, which allows the user to submit any value entered into the system. The other button is a basic clear button that simply removes any information that the system has outputted

3.	Edit text - There is only one edit text to keep things simple and avoid confusing users. All this edit text does is allow the user to enter a value. This editing text relates to the submit button.

4.	Text views: Two text views were utilized throughout the application. The first option is the simplest. It just says "The History App" and serves as the app's title. However, the result text view is the app's most essential feature. Without it, the user would not receive the necessary information when entering a specific number into the system.



When the user entered a value, there were ten alternative possible results. When the user enters a specific value, the following information will be displayed


John Fitzgerald Kennedy (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), often referred to as JFK, was an American politician who served as the 35th president of the United States from 1961 until his assassination in 1963. He was the youngest person elected president"

"Lee Harvey Oswald (October 18, 1939 – November 24, 1963) was a U.S. Marine veteran who assassinated John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States, on November 22, 1963"

"Lincoln's legacy is based on his momentous achievements: he successfully waged a political struggle and civil war that preserved the Union, ended slavery, and created the possibility of civil and social freedom for African-Americans"

"John Wilkes Booth was part of a family of celebrated actors, but he is remembered as the assassin who mortally wounded U.S. Pres. Abraham Lincoln in Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., on April 14, 1865, as part of a broader conspiracy that included an attempt on the life of Secretary of State William H. Seward"

"His adoption of nonviolent resistance to achieve equal rights for Black Americans earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. King is remembered for his masterful oratorical skills, most memorably in his \"I Have a Dream\" speech."

"James Earl Ray (March 10, 1928 – April 23, 1998) was an American fugitive convicted of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968"

"Franz Ferdinand was an Archduke of Austria-Este, Austro-Hungarian and Royal Prince of Hungary and of Bohemia and, from 1896 until his death, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne. His assassination in Sarajevo precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia."

" Gavrilo Princip. Princip, Gavrilo (1894 -1918) Born: Oblej. The Bosnian-Serb who shot and killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and set the wheels of world war in motion."


"William McKinley (January 29, 1843 – September 14, 1901) was an American politician who served as the 25th president of the United States from 1897 until his assassination in 1901."

"Leon Czolgosz was an American worker. He is known for killing the 25th President of the United States, William McKinley. Czolgosz was inspired by anarchist ideas. Anarchism is a belief that a workers' revolution should abolish the state and the capitalist class so that the working people would govern themselves."

Theme 
The app's topic revolves around the music industry. The artists' names and other information are displayed. The user would enter values until they reached the value at which the artist passed away, and the app would display information about their accomplishments. The software is intended to be user-friendly, with simply two buttons and an edit text. One button submits the user's inputted age, while the other clears any information on the screen. The edit text is the most significant component of the app since without it, the user will be unable to submit their value to the system.
